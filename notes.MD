spinning Donut Notes for  implementing the MAGIC donut mofos


pixels i will use  -  .,-~:;=!*#$@ 



algorithms used: Z-buffer, framebuffer


raytracing: a method to simulate lighting


to calculate the the distance we should reconcider

- formular to descripe the cordinates on our screen 
- bc we dont have any z cordinate on a 2d screen we need to calculate it different
- since z is a constant rename it to  = K1 
y'/z' = y/z
y' = yz'/z

-  (x′,y′)=(K1xz,K1yz) formular to describe the 2d points we want to see on the screen
<>

k1 < 25 ( with a 100x100 pixel size)

Okay this programm is super Complicated and soo fucking cool
